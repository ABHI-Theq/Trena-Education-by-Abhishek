            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Knowledge is a form of awareness or familiarity. It is often understood
                as awareness of facts or as practical skills, and may also mean familiarity with objects or situations.
                Knowledge of facts, also called propositional knowledge, is often defined as true belief that is
                distinct from opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification. While there is wide agreement among
                philosophers that propositional knowledge is a form of true belief, many controversies in philosophy
                focus on justification. This includes questions like whether justification is needed at all, how to
                understand it, and whether something else besides it is needed. These controversies intensified due to a
                series of thought experiments by Edmund Gettier and have provoked various alternative definitions. Some
                of them deny that justification is necessary and suggest alternative criteria. Others accept that
                justification is an essential aspect and formulate additional requirements.

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education.These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge,
                behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. The ability to learn is possessed by humans,
                animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants .Some
                learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and
                knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a
                lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot
                be retrieved.The changes induced by learning often last a
